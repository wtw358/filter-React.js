I use React.js to create a live filtering page.

## Setup ##

### Install Packages ###
In order to use React, we first need to install different external packages (aka javascript/css frameworks that other people wrote). I have already created a list of dependencies needed (in `package.json`) but you will need to install them into your local computer by doing the following:
* `cd` into `src` folder
* Run `npm install`
  * If you do not have npm installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)


### Running a local server ###
Once you installed the packages, you can run a simple server to see my work in the browser. This can be done by using python's SimpleHTTPServer:
* `cd` back to `cs1300-development`
* Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
  * This will create a server from the cs1300-development directory
  * If you do not have python you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (download python 2.7)
* Now on your browser, go to localhost:8000 to see my work!
